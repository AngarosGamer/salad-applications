Salad allows gamers to earn rewards from their PCs. We turn your GPU power into credits you can spend on items like subscriptions, games, gift cards, and more from our curated storefront.

Unfortunately, you're looking at an obsolete branch. You'll want to navigate to our [current branch](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/salad-applications/tree/master) if you're looking to learn more about or use Salad.
